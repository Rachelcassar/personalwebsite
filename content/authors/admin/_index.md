I am a psychology PhD student and a member of the Face Research Lab at the University of Glasgow. My PhD investigates the methodologies and theoretical explanations used in the study of perceived facial similarity in mate choice, i.e. whether couples look alike. My research interests include exprimental psychology, evolutionary psychology, kin recognition, perception, as well as gender and social inequalities. 

Throughout my PhD I have worked part-time as a research assistant on projects on face perception, education and gender inequalities. I am currently working as a research assistant at the University of Stirling on a project investigating care-giving in human and non-human primates. I am proficient at creating face stimuli using WebMorph, MorphAnalyser and Photoshop and have created both human (2D and 3D) and non-human primate (2D) facial stimuli for use in online and eye tracking studies. I use R to conduct all my data wrangling and analyses, most of which is reproducible and openly available.

I studied accountancy and finance in Malta, before switching to a career in science in Scotland where I currently live. I have two dogs who occupy most of my heart and free time. I also enjoy learning about different cultures, design, yoga, knitting and coding in R (if I had more time I would love to learn other languages).
