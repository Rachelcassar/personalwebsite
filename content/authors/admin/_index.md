I am currently a Statistician and former academic in the field of Pyschology, or rather, Behavioural Science. I first created this page as a place to showcase my research interests, papers and contact information. My intention now is to maintain this website as an online CV, and eventually a place to share my portfolio of data analysis projects that I am working on in my own time.

As for my background, I first studied accountancy and finance in Malta, working in audit at PwC Malta and business strategy at MeDirect Bank (then Mediterranean Bank). My research career kicked off in 2017, when I commenced a PhD in Psychology and Neuroscience as a member of the Face Research Lab at the University of Glasgow. My PhD investigated methodologies and theoretical explanations used in the study of perceived facial similarity in mate choice. I used a quantitative approach with 2-alternative forced-choice tasks (binary) to measure preferences, and likert scales to measure ratings. Through my doctorate, I developed a rigorous analytical mindset, approaching questions with curiosity and applying structured, effective strategies to solve complex problems. 

In tandem with my doctoral research, I worked part-time as a research assistant on projects involving face perception, education and gender inequalities (socioeconomic indicators) as well as care-giving behvaiour in human and non-human primates (chimpanzees). I am proficient at creating face stimuli using WebMorph, MorphAnalyser and Photoshop and have created both human (2D and 3D) and non-human primate (2D) facial stimuli for use in online and eye tracking studies. 

*I have used R to conduct all data wrangling and analyses, some of which are reproducible and openly available.*

As a postdoctorate, I worked in the University of Malta's department of Physiology and Biochemistry on a collaborative project analysing whole brain MRI scans using quantitative metrics, and later in the department of Cognitive Science on a project investigating the evolution of the Maltese language using audio recordings from a language production experiment.

I am now working as a statistician with the NSO's Structural Business Statistics Unit. In my free time, whenever possible, I do online courses on Python, SQL and other data science-related subjects. I particularly enjoy data visualisations and would love to soon transfer my skills from ggplot2 to Power BI or Tableau.

I have two dogs who occupy most of my heart and free time. I also enjoy learning about different cultures, travelling, design, and computer programming. Get in touch for any questions or data chats :)
